### Main Points
* The dark channel of the haze image will have higher intensity in regions with denser haze
* Intensity of dark channel intensity of haze

### Implementation details
* assume transmission in local patch omega(x) is constant
* Not good prior for sky regions but transmission is zero so( as its same as atmospheric light)
